    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Nigerian fried rice is one of the most popular rice recipes in Nigeria. It has become a big party favorite and one of the most sought after delicacies in any festive gathering.
        Unlike other Nigerian rice recipes, the Fried rice is prepared by stir frying seasoned precooked  rice with a mixture of vegetables and cooked proteins(meat/chicken or prawns).

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a pan big enough to cook rice on medium heat, add oil, heat until hot.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onions, curry powder, thyme, and powder; fry for about one minute to release the fragrance.</li>
        <li>Add washed rice and stir continuously for about 2-3 minutes. (Don’t let the rice stick to the bottom of the pot)</li>
        <li>Add chicken stock (if the stock is not enough to cover the rice, add water to it), ginger, garlic, and seasoning.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat and simmer until tender. Check-in between cooking time, add water to the rice if needed.</li>
        <li>Don't forget to check for salt and seasoning and adjust to suit your taste.</li>
        <li>While you are waiting for your rice to cook, you can stir fry the vegetables or just wait until the rice is cooked.</li>
        <li>Place a wok or skillet on medium heat, add oil and butter, and heat until hot.</li>
        <li>Add the vegetables, prawns, salt, and stir fry for another 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add a pinch of curry and thyme and stir continuously for another 3 minutes or until veggies are tender but not overcooked.</li>
        <li>If you are using processed green peas, don’t add them to your stir fry as they would go mushy. Add them 2 minutes towards the end of the cooking time.</li>
        <li>If you used a large skillet to stir fry the veggies, add the cooked rice to it, mix until fully combined.</li>
        <li>Check for salt and seasoning and adjust to suit.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, add the stir-fried veggies into the rice. Mix to combine and continue to cook for another 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Take it off the heat and serve.</li>
      </ol>
